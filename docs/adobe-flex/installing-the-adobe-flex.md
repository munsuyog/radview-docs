# Installing the Adobe Flex Add-on

The Adobe Flex Add-on is installed with WebLOAD but requires activation. The add-on's components remain invisible until you apply an appropriate license. In order to activate the Adobe Flex Add-on, contact RadView for an appropriate license. For more information about license registration, refer to *Registering and Updating the WebLOAD License*, located in the *WebLOAD Installation Guide*.
