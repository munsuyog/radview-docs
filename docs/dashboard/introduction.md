# Introduction

RadView’s WebLOAD Dashboard provides a single unified command and control interface for creating, executing, scheduling, and analyzing tests – all directly from your web browser, either on-premises or in the Cloud.

Some of the tasks you can accomplish using WebLOAD Dashboard include:

- **Create and Edit Load Tests:** You can create and edit load tests based on a WebLOAD script, a WebLOAD template, or using a single URL/API.

- **Upload, Add, and Manage Tests, Resources, and Sessions:** Manage your tests, resources, and sessions efficiently within the dashboard.

- **Execute and Schedule Test Runs:** Execute tests immediately or schedule them for later runs.

- **Analyze Results:** Utilize ready-made and self-configured dashboards to analyze test results effectively.

- **Share Tests and Results:** Share tests and results with your peers for collaboration and feedback.

- **Manage Access Permissions:** Control access permissions for users and groups to ensure data security.

- **Download Test Results:** Download test results to your local machine for further analysis with WebLOAD Analytics.

**Important Note**

In previous WebLOAD versions, a WebLOAD script was called an “Agenda”. From version 12.0, it is referred to simply as a script. Wherever “Agenda” is still displayed, we are referring to the WebLOAD script.

Additionally, WebLOAD Recorder was formerly referred to as WebLOAD IDE.
