# Registering and Updating the WebLOAD License

Your WebLOAD license must be registered before you can start working with WebLOAD. WebLOAD licenses that have expired must also be renewed or updated before you can continue working with WebLOAD. When installing a new major or minor version of WebLOAD, make sure that you have an adequate license for that specific version. All license registration and updating is accomplished through the Update License dialog box.

You can register and update your WebLOAD license either through an Update License application or through the Command Line Interface.

### WebRM Server

The WebRM Server is a stand-alone tool that manages all resource distribution to WebLOAD Console, which is the machine used to run loads in a WebRM environment.

It is the method that controls the number of users allowed to access the product concurrently.

WebRM for virtual clients is available and defined as a pool of virtual (probing) clients that can concurrently be used by members of a testing team and monitored by the WebRM Server.

During installation of the WebRM server, you are prompted for the WebRM file that defines:

- The number of concurrent applications for the WebLOAD Console.
- The number of concurrent Virtual and Probing Clients.

Installation also creates a FlexLM Service that controls the operation.

The WebRM Server displays a list of the number of resources (Virtual and Probing Clients) that the Console is using. The WebRM Server enables a testing team to share resources.

This section describes how to connect to the WebRM Server and how to view the license details.
