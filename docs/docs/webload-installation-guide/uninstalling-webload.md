# Chapter 7. Uninstalling WebLOAD

When you uninstall WebLOAD, you are prompted to remove PostgreSQL 8.3, which is used to manage the WebLOAD Analytics database. RadView Software recommends that you keep PostgreSQL 8.3 installed in order to maintain all the information stored in the database.

## To Uninstall WebLOAD:

1. Close all WebLOAD modules including TestTalk.

2. Close all browser windows that are open.

3. Select **Start** > **Settings** > **Control Panel**.

4. Double-click the **Add/Remove Programs** icon.

5. Click the **Change or Remove Programs** tab.

6. Click **Radview WebLOAD Professional**, and then click **Change/Remove**.

    The Uninstall Wizard appears. Once the uninstall procedure is complete, you may be prompted to restart your machine.

    **Note:** Uninstalling WebLOAD removes all the WebLOAD program file directories, including all the WebLOAD installation files. User files that are copied into these directories (such as user-defined extensions) are not deleted. WebLOAD load templates, load sessions, and script files are not removed -- they can be used with all WebLOAD upgrades.

    **Caution:** Close TestTalk and all browser windows before uninstalling WebLOAD. Failure to close TestTalk and all browser windows results in outdated files remaining on your disk, which could adversely affect future installations of the program.
