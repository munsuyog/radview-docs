3. Give the new playlist a **Name** and configure the time **Interval** to wait while displaying each dashboard before advancing to the next one on the Playlist.

4. Add dashboards to the playlist as follows:

   a. Optionally search for dashboards by name (or use a regular expression) or you could add tags which will include all the dashboards that belong to a tag when the playlist starts playing. By default, your starred dashboards will appear as candidates for the Playlist.

   b. In the **Available** column, add a dashboard to the Playlist by clicking **Add to playlist** adjacent to the dashboard name.

   The dashboard you added appears in the **Selected** column.
