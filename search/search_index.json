You can also set various display options, such as colors, graph style (lines, bars, points), Y-axis formats (bytes, milliseconds, etc.), and more. Table Panel A table panel presents data in table format; by default, the log messages from specified sessions. You can sort the display by various parameters and filter the display by severity. Text Panel A text panel presents text. You can edit the text. Singlestat Panel A singlestat panel is similar to a graph panel but shows only a single statistic, usually in numeric form. It may contain a 'sparkline' and may appear as a gauge. Note that because a singlestat panel displays only one measurement, it is not suitable when comparing two or more sessions. Alert List Panel Reserved for future use. Dashboard List Panel Reserved for future use. Plugin List Panel Reserved for future use. Specifying the Sessions to view in the Dashboard WebLOAD Dashboard dashboards are useful both for analyzing the results of a specific session and for comparing the results of different sessions. To select a session for viewing in the dashboard tab: Do any of the following: In the Load Sessions table, click the session name. The session appears in the currently selected dashboard. In Load Tests table, click the Show Last Session button. To select multiple sessions for viewing in the dashboard tab, click Show in Dashboard for each session you wish to view in the Dashboard. Specifying the Zoom Using a graph panel's zoom option, you can set the time period for which all panels display information. For example, if you select to zoom into the time period from 00:30 to 01:00, all panels will refresh to show information for that time period only, and the metric panels, for example, will display metrics for that time period only. To zoom in: Use the mouse to select a specific time range in the panel. The dashboard refreshes to show the graph for the selected time range only. To zoom out: Use the Zoom to Data or Zoom Out options in the dashboard header. Selecting the Time Format You can view dashboard data in either Relative time or Absolute time (see item \u2466 in Figure 33). This affects the graphs' display as follows: If you are viewing data for a single session: Relative time -- The start time is shifted over to zero. Absolute time -- Shows the real time. This format is useful for viewing currently running sessions. If you are comparing sessions: Relative time -- The graph shows the two sessions as if they occurred concurrently (within the same timeframe). Absolute time -- The graphs show the real time. Setting the Time Picker If you selected the Time Picker (see item \u2469 in Figure 33), you can set various time settings. You can, for example, set the auto-refresh frequency.","title":"Using Dashboards"},{"location":"dashboard/using-dashboards/#using-dashboards","text":"The Dashboards tab enables viewing, analyzing, and comparing load sessions, with full control and customization of the display.

This affects the graphs' display as follows: If you are viewing data for a single session: Relative time -- The start time is shifted over to zero. Absolute time -- Shows the real time. This format is useful for viewing currently running sessions. If you are comparing sessions: Relative time -- The graph shows the two sessions as if they occurred concurrently (within the same timeframe).
